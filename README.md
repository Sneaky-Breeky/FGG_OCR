# FGG_OCR
Welcome to the repo of my prev ML internship at FGG, Shenzhen!\
./gpt-lawyer-frontend is the remotely deployed frontend interface of the project\
./Legal-Chat-Doc is the illustrations of the algorithms and designs (needs translation maybe!)\
./PaddleOCR is the real OCR framework named PaddlePaddle, fine-tuned models included.\\

Happy exploring!
